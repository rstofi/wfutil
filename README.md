# wfutil
---

Waterfall util is a collection of utility code to work with time and channel (frequency) arrays and time-frequency data matrices for creating wtarefall plots.

This code defines a custom data format to store and manipulate data in the time-frequency space. The code builds on numpy rather than e.g. `xarray` as the idea is to tackle specific problems.
